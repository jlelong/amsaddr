# AMSADDR

This package is intended to be used with the `amsart` document class
only. It lets you move the authors' affiliations either just below the
authors' names on the front page or as footnotes on the first
page. The email addresses are always listed as a footnote on the front
page.

To produce the `amsaddr.sty` file simply run `latex amsaddr.ins`.
